				Wordle is a word puzzle game where a user attempts to guess a certain word based on hints from previous guesses. The official game was purchased by The New York Times and can be found <b><a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target = "_blank">here</a></b>. According to the game page, the rules are as follows:<br><br>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>Green letter - Letter is in the word and in the correct spot</li>
					<li>Yellow letter - Letter is in the word but wrong spot</li>
					<li>Gray letter - Letter is not in the word in any spot</li>
				</ul>

				<br>The program was written in Python with the help of the Pandas library which allows for quick and efficient data manipulation using Dataframes. The video demonstrates the program solving a variety of words from lengths 4 to 11. With 18 words solved in the demonstration, it was done faster than one word per minute. The Wordle game site used in the demonstration can be found <b><a href = "https://wordlegame.org/" target = "_blank">here</a></b>.

				<div class = "text">The Unexpected Edge Case</div>
				It was not until I was done writing version 1 of the program and started testing it that I realized that there was an edge case. The gray letter's condition- <b>Letter is not in the word in any spot</b> can actually be misleading because the Green and Yellow letter's condition take precedence over it.<br><br>
				For example when the answer is <b>TRAIT</b>, if you guess <b>NAVAL</b>, the first <b>A</b> will be yellow and the second <b>A</b> will be gray. The presence of the second gray <b>A</b> does not, however, mean that the letter <b>A</b> will not be found in the answer.
				<br><br>
				Similarly, if you guess <b>DRAMA</b>, the first <b>A</b> will be green and the second <b>A</b> will be gray. Therefore, the presence of a gray letter means that it does not appear in the answer <b>if and only if</b> that letter does not appear green or yellow elsewhere in the guessed word.
				<br><br>
				It may seem like the only useful information we can obtain from a gray letter that is present in a guess where it also appears as green or yellow is that the letter does not appear in that gray spot in the final answer. However, there is actually some valuable information we can gain from this edge case.

		<div class = "bottom_info">
			<div class = "edge_case2">
				<div class = "text">Exploiting the Edge Case</div>
				In the previous example, we saw that the first <b>A</b> in DRAMA was green while the second <b>A</b> was gray. Apart from knowing that the fifth letter in the final answer is not <b>A</b>, we can also deduce that the final answer will only have one <b>A</b> in it due to the presence of the gray <b>A</b> at the end.
				<br><br>
				In the absence of a gray letter, the most we can assume is that we will have at least the number of green + yellow letters in the final answer. For example, when we guess <b>TARTS</b>, we know for sure that the final answer will have at least two <b>T</b>s but we will not know the exact number. Similarly when we guess <b>BUTTS</b>, we know that the final answer will have at least two <b>T</b>s.<br><br>
				In the presence of a gray letter, we can conclude the number of <b>T</b>s we will see in the final answer. In addition to telling us where that letter will not be, the presence of a gray letter also serves as an upper limit to the number of times we can see that letter appear in the answer. For example, due to the third <b>T</b> being gray in the word <b>TUTTI</b>, we are able to conclude that the final answer has exactly two <b>T</b>s.

				<div class = "text">How well the Program does so far</div>
				There are about 2300 total answers in the New York Times Wordle game and nearly 13000 possible valid words to enter as guesses. The program went through each of the 2300 answers and started off each time by randomly selecting from the list of 13000 possible valid words as a guess. It was assumed that the answer could be any of the 13000 possible valid guesses just to challenge the program and see how well it could do.<br><br>

				The conditions were then evaluated based on the feedback color codes. The program continued to randomly select from the list of possible answers that fit the previously accumulated conditions. This process was repeated until it arrived at the correct answer.<br><br>
				The average number of guesses required to arrive at the correct answer was about <b>4.888</b>.<br><br>
				A demonstration video and additional detailed information including the word guess history, chances of winning  and number of possible answers on each guess round and bits of information obtained can be found <b><a href = "https://ma562.github.io/Wordle-Solver-with-Random-Selection-/">here</a></b>.

				<div class = "text">Determining the Best Starter Word</div>
				First of all, we have to define what we mean by the best starter word. In this case, the best starter word would be the word which on average gives us the most information or leaves us with the least number of possible words left to choose from. To illustrate this, on the left column in the matching diagram, we have the list of valid words to be used as guesses. From Aahed to Zymic, the Wordle game accepts 12953 guesses as valid words. On the right column, we have the list of Wordle answers which will be used in the New York Times which amount to about 2310 words. Each of the 12953 possible guesses will be sent in as an answer towards each of the 2310 words. The average amount of information and number of possibilities will be calculated for each of the 12953 words. <br><br>
				For example, when <b>Aahed</b> is used as a guess when the answer is <b>Aback</b>, we will get <span style="background-color:#6ca965">a</span><span style="background-color:#c8b653">a</span><span style="background-color:#787c7f">hed</span>. The number of words that match the criteria based on the color feedback is 139 so we went from 12539 possible guesses down to 139. This gives us about 6.495 bits of information since number of possibile words was halved about 6.495 times.<br><br>If we use <b>Aahed</b> when the answer is <b>Abase</b>, we will get  <span style="background-color:#6ca965">a</span><span style="background-color:#c8b653">a</span><span style="background-color:#787c7f">h</span><span style="background-color:#c8b653">e</span><span style="background-color:#787c7f">d</span>. The number of words that match the criteria based on the color feedback is 38. This gives us about 8.366 bits of information.<br><br>
				If we use <b>Aahed</b> when the answer is <b>Zesty</b>, we will get <span style="background-color:#787c7f">aah</span><span style="background-color:#c8b653">e</span><span style="background-color:#787c7f">d</span>. The number of words that match the criteria based on the color feedback is 1634. This gives us about 2.940 bits of information.<br><br>
				If we use <b>Aahed</b> when the answer is <b>Zonal</b>, we will get <span style="background-color:#c8b653">a</span><span style="background-color:#787c7f">ahed</span>. The number of words that match the criteria based on the color feedback is 1126. This gives us about 3.477 bits of information.<br><br>
				Aahed would be passed to all 2310 words. The average bits of information and number of words left that match the criteria will be computed to evaluate how good it is. The average number of bits of information from Aahed was <b>4.468</b> bits and the average number of words left that match the criteria was about <b>1048.32</b> words. This will be evaluated for all 12953 words. With nearly <b>30 million</b> iterations, this program took a very long time to run but the results seem to be worth it in the end. While the average number of bits and average number of possible words left yielded different results (which is not surprising given that the logarithm is non-linear), it was quite clear that <b>Soare</b> was one of the best openers as it yielded an average of <b>6.245</b> bits of information and left us with an average of <b>273.92</b> words left to choose from.
				A summary of the results can be found below. The code and full results can be found <b><a href = "https://github.com/ma562/best_wordle_starters" target = "_blank">here</a></b>.<br><br>

				<div class = "text">Making the most out of each guess</div>
				Perhaps we can gain some insight into how to reduce the number of guesses by observing the guess history for words that take an especially large number of guesses. <br><br>
				Just for example, we might end up with a list of possiblities looking like:<br><br>
				<ul class = "shift">
					<li>maker</li>
					<li>taker</li>
					<li>baker</li>
					<li>faker</li>
					<li>mater</li>
					<li>poker</li>
				</ul><br>
				Rather than randomly select from the list of possible answers, it might be a better idea to guess a word like <b>ambit</b>. This method will be more efficient in shrinking the list of possible answers. <br><br>
				<li>If we get <span style="background-color:#c8b653">a</span>, then we can eliminate <b>poker</b>. Otherwise if we get <span style="background-color:#787c7f">a</span>, we can conclude the answer is <b>poker</b>.</li>
				<li>If we get <span style="background-color:#c8b653">m</span>, then we know the answer is either <b>maker</b> or <b>mater</b>. Otherwise, if we get <span style="background-color:#787c7f">m</span>, we can eliminate <b>maker</b> and <b>mater</b>.</li>
				<li>If we get <span style="background-color:#c8b653">b</span>, we know the answer is <b>baker</b>. Otherwise, if we get <span style="background-color:#787c7f">b</span>, we can eliminate <b>baker</b>.</li>
				<li>If we get <span style="background-color:#c8b653">t</span>, we know the answer is either <b>taker</b> or <b>mater</b>. Otherwise, if we get <span style="background-color:#787c7f">t</span>, we can eliminate <b>taker</b> and <b>mater</b></li>
				<br>
				With this method implemented and the word <b>tares</b> being used to start off each guess, the average number of guesses required to arrive at the correct answer was about <b>4.502</b>.<br><br>
